# KaraScore — Deferred Items

This document tracks features and tasks that were intentionally skipped
during development to keep the current scope focused.

---

## Deferred so far

- Real-time pitch analysis during recording  
  (Current approach: record first, analyze after stop)

- Live pitch visualization in the UI  
  (Current UI shows only basic status)

- Microphone calibration and noise handling  
  (Assumes controlled environment for now)

- Optional C++ implementation for performance-critical audio or scoring components  
  (Only if Python performance becomes insufficient)
